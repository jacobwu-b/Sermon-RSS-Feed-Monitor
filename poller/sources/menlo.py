"""Menlo Church: Podbean RSS feed + Legacy/Midweek exclusion.

The feed mixes main Sunday sermons with the Legacy (traditional) service and
the Midweek Podcast; only main Sunday sermons are in scope. Legacy and Midweek
content is recognized by title only (main-sermon blurbs cross-promote the
Midweek Podcast by name, so the blurb is not a reliable exclude signal). Any
item published on a Sunday that is neither is included; anything else is
ambiguous. Within a Sunday-anchored week with no Sunday item, the ambiguous
item closest to Sunday is promoted as the late-posted main sermon.
