"""Lakepointe Church (Rockwall, TX): Megaphone podcast feed, Sunday + denylist.

Classification is North Point's rule plus a denylist. The feed's ``pubDate``
is trustworthy here (unlike Westgate's), so the weekday check runs on it
directly. What North Point does not have is a set of non-sermon series
sharing the feed: "Bonus Podcast", "Church At Home", and "Bonus Q&A"
episodes — every one of them published on a non-Sunday in a sampled feed, so
the weekday check alone would exclude them today, but they are named anyway
so a bonus episode that one week publishes on a Sunday doesn't get mistaken
for a sermon.

Two fields are permanently empty for Lakepointe: the feed emits no ``<link>``
and no ``<description>`` on any item, so ``episode_url`` and ``blurb`` are
always ``""``.
