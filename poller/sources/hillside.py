"""Hillside Church (San Jose): Subsplash podcast feed, title read out of description.

Two things about this feed are unlike every other source:

- The sermon's name is not in ``<title>``. The current title format is
  ``"{M.D.YY} | {scripture} | {speaker}"`` (e.g. ``"9.6.26 | Hebrews 13:7–17 |
  Keith Crosby"``) and the sermon's actual name is the first paragraph of the
  HTML ``<description>`` (e.g. ``"A Parting Conversation"``). The description's
  first paragraph becomes the record title; the raw feed title supplies a
  speaker fallback instead.
- The title's date is not the classification signal here (the opposite of
  Westgate): of a 23-item sample, 22 agreed with ``pubDate`` and one named the
  day *after* the actual Sunday. So this adapter classifies on ``pubDate``.
