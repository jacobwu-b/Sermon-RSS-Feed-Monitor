"""The per-church adapter contract.

A :class:`SourceAdapter` fetches one church's feed and returns the main
sermons it finds as normalized :class:`SermonItem` records. Everything a church
adapter needs to decide — which items are the main Sunday sermon versus a
different program sharing the same feed — lives in the adapter; everything
downstream of that decision (storing it, notifying about it) is
church-agnostic and lives in :mod:`poller.runner`.
